# Data Structures by Hand

Most modern languages come with a standard library that implement efficient versions of 
data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. The modern software engineer
has become comfortable with this situation and have all but forgotten how to implement said 
structures from first principles. This library is the fruit of my study into this topic
and the result are several data structures implemented from scratch and by hand.

_Note:_  Use it at your own risk. YMMV!
