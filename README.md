# Data Structures from Scratch

Most modern languages come with a standard library that implement efficient versions of 
data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. The modern software engineer
has become comfortable with this situation and have all but forgotten how to implement said 
structures from first principles. This library is the fruit of my studies in this topic
and the result are several data structures implemented from scratch.

One of the main goals of this project is to have no external imports in the implementations 
of the data structures, except for imports from within the same base `org.nixdork.datastructures` 
package. Of course, tests are allowed to have third-party imports. 

_Note:_  Use it at your own risk. YMMV!
